						<dd>So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these?” He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.” He said to him, “Feed My lambs.”</dd>
											<dt>16</dt>
						<dd>He said to him again a second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me?” He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.” He said to him, “Tend My sheep.”</dd>
											<dt>17</dt>
						<dd>He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me?” Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, “Do you love Me?” And he said to Him, “Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.” Jesus said to him, “Feed My sheep.</dd>
											<dt>18</dt>
						<dd>Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.”</dd>
											<dt>19</dt>
						<dd>This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, “Follow Me.”</dd>
											<dt>20</dt>
						<dd>Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, and said, “Lord, who is the one who betrays You?”</dd>
											<dt>21</dt>
						<dd>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, “But Lord, what about this man?”</dd>
											<dt>22</dt>
						<dd>Jesus said to him, “If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.”</dd>
											<dt>23</dt>
						<dd>Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, “If I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you?”</dd>
											<dt>24</dt>
						<dd>This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</dd>
											<dt>25</dt>
						<dd>And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.</dd>

				<p>The paschal season of the Church is preceded by the season of Great Lent, which is also preceded by its own liturgical preparation. The first sign of the approach of Great Lent comes five Sundays before its beginning. On this Sunday the Gospel reading is about Zacchaeus the tax-collector. It tells how Christ brought salvation to the sinful man, and how his life was changed simply because he “sought to see who Jesus was” (Luke 19:3). The desire and effort to see Jesus begins the entire movement through Lent towards Pascha. It is the first movement of salvation.</p><p>Our lenten journey begins with a recognition of our own sinfulness, just as Zacchaeus recognized his. He promised to make restitution by giving half of his wealth to the poor, and by paying to those he had falsely accused four times as much as they had lost. In this, he went beyond the requirements of the Law (Ex. 22:3-12).</p><p>The example of Zacchaeus teaches us that we should turn away from our sins, and atone for them. The real proof of our sorrow and repentance is not just a verbal apology, but when we correct ourselves and try to make amends for the consequences of our evil actions. </p><p>We are also assured of God’s mercy and compassion by Christ’s words to Zacchaeus, “Today salvation is come to this house” (Luke 19:9). After the Great Doxology and Trisagion at Sunday Matins (when the Tone of the week is in Tone 1, 3, 5, or 7) we sing the Troparion of the Resurrection: “Today salvation is come to the world, let us sing praises to Him Who arose from the tomb, and is the Author of our life. For having destroyed death by death, He has given us the victory and great mercy.”</p><p>Zacchaeus was short, so he climbed a tree in order to see the Lord. All of us have sinned and come short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23).  We are also short in our spiritual stature, therefore we must climb the ladder of the virtues. In other words, we must prepare for spiritual effort and growth.</p><p>Saint Zacchaeus is also commemorated on April 20.		</p></article>`,

				<p>The Transfer of the Relics of the Hieromartyr Ignatius the God-Bearer: (See December 20). After the holy hieromartyr Ignatius was thrown to the lions in the year 107 on the orders of the emperor Trajan, Christians gathered up his bones and preserved them at Rome.</p><p>Later, in the year 108, the saint’s relics were collected and buried outside the gate of Daphne at Antioch. A second transfer, to the city of Antioch itself, took place in the year 438. After the capture of Antioch by the Persians, the relics of the Hieromartyr Ignatius were returned to Rome and placed into the church of the holy Hieromartyr Clement in the year 540 (in 637, according to other sources).</p><p>Saint Ignatius introduced antiphonal singing into Church services. He has left us seven archpastoral epistles in which he provided instructions on faith, love and good works. He also urged his flock to preserve the unity of the faith and to beware of heretics. He encouraged people to honor and obey their bishops, “We should regard the bishop as we would the Lord Himself.” (To the Ephesians 6)</p><p>In his Letter to Polycarp, Saint Ignatius writes: “Listen to the bishop, if you want God to listen to you... let your baptism be your shield, your faith a helmet, your charity a spear, your patience, like full armor.” (Compare Eph. 6:14-17 and the Wisdom of Solomon 5:17-20.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One would not have guessed that the question of whether to receive a person into the Orthodox Church by baptism and chrismation or by chrismation alone would be a hot issue given the history of reception into the Church.&nbsp; Both methods have been widely used in the ancient and recent past and continue to be used in the present.</p>
<p>This is not something in the order of magnitude of (for example) the existence of purgatory, the addition of the Filioque to the Creed, or even the use of unleavened bread in the Eucharist.&nbsp; That is, it is hardly the liturgical hill to die on.&nbsp; But it seems to have become a hot issue because some influential and loud people are now insisting that receiving a convert by chrismation alone is an “error” and one that must be “corrected” by re-baptizing the convert who was received by chrismation alone.&nbsp; This re-baptism goes by the name of “corrective baptism” and is apparently widespread enough so that the term turns up on Google.&nbsp; (I checked.)&nbsp; We live in a strange world.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/nootherfoundation/ecclesiastical-gnosticism/">already written</a> about the ecclesiastical significance of this movement.&nbsp; I have also written of my personal preference for making baptism the normative way for receiving pretty much every convert to Orthodoxy.&nbsp; The question to be examined here is the larger question of the importance of the method chosen.&nbsp; That is, is it <em>absolutely</em> <em>crucial</em> that one method be chosen over another?&nbsp; Granted for the sake of argument that a convert should ideally be received by baptism, what if that convert is received chrismation?&nbsp; Is it necessary to be baptized again at a later date?&nbsp; Does the phrase “<em>should</em> be received” actually mean “<em>must</em> be received”?&nbsp; That is the question examined here.</p>
<p>We note first that in St. Basil’s day a number of methods of reception were used.&nbsp; In his <em>Letter 188, to Amphilochius, Concerning the Canons </em>(which may be <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3202188.htm">accessed here</a>) St. Basil alludes to three of them.&nbsp; In one section of the letter (preserved by posterity as “Canon 1”) he dealt with the issue of how different groups were to be received upon returning to Orthodoxy. He distinguished between 1. heresies; 2. schisms; 3. unlawful congregations.</p>
<p>By “heresies” he meant groups that had “altogether broken off and alienated in matters relating to the actual faith”. These were groups which required full baptism before they could be admitted to the Church. &nbsp;By “schisms” he meant groups that “separated for some ecclesiastical reasons and questions capable of mutual solution”—groups such those which “disagree with members of the Church about repentance”. &nbsp;The Church could accept the baptism of these schismatics, so that they required only chrismation before being admitted. &nbsp;By “unlawful congregations” he meant, a man “convicted of crime, and prohibited from discharging ministerial functions, [who] then refuses to submit to the canons, but arrogates to himself episcopal and ministerial rights, and persons&nbsp;[who] leave the Catholic Church&nbsp;and join him”. &nbsp;People from this group were readmitted to the Church “after they had been brought to a better state by proper repentance and rebuke”.</p>
<p>In examining the details of St. Basil’s advice (it was, after all, only his personal pastoral opinion, not a canon like the canons of the Second Ecumenical which were the consensus work of many bishops) we see some interesting things.</p>
<p>St. Basil mentions the example of St. Cyprian, who rejected the baptism of schismatic groups outside the Church.&nbsp; But Basil goes on to say, “Nevertheless, since it has seemed to some of those of Asia that, for the sake of management of the majority, their baptism should be accepted, let it be accepted.”&nbsp; That is, the peace of the Church based on the practice of the majority was the deciding factor, not that of canonical or theological precision.</p>
<p>In the same way, Basil preferred to reject the baptism of the rigorist Encratites of his day. &nbsp;But he then says, “If, however, there is any likelihood of this being detrimental to general discipline, we must fall back upon custom, and follow the Fathers who have ordered what course we are to pursue.&nbsp; For I am under some apprehension lest, in our wish to discourage them from baptizing, we may, through the severity of our decision, be a hindrance to those who are being saved.”&nbsp; Doubtless it was because of this that, although he preferred to reject Encratite baptism, he admitted that he “received into episcopal rank Izois and Saturninus from the Encratite following”.</p>
<p>The theological rationale behind which method of reception was to be used is far from clear, and the decisions seemed to have been based upon the pastoral needs of the moment.&nbsp; That was because there was no obvious apostolic precedent for resolving such a question, and was why bishops like Stephen of Rome (d. 257) and Cyprian of Carthage (d. 258) and could use different methods while both appealing to antiquity and tradition.&nbsp; Cyprian and North Africa followed one custom; Rome, Egypt, and Palestine followed another.&nbsp; It seems that both customs could claim some antiquity.&nbsp; This flexibility of usage served to keep the peace within the Church, and this peace took precedence over theological considerations about which method of reception was best.</p>
<p>It also produced what are, to us, some odd results.&nbsp; According to Canon 95 of the Quinisext Council in 692, Arians were to be received by chrismation, while Paulianists had be baptized.&nbsp; Moreover, Manichaeans, Valentinians, and Marcionites were to be received simply by renouncing their errors and receiving Holy Communion.&nbsp; Given that the Arians famously denied the divinity of Christ and that Paulianists (i.e. followers of Paul of Samosata) were not much different in terms of Christological heterodoxy, and given that the Manichaeans and the Valentinians were arguably another religion entirely, it is all a bit surprising.&nbsp; Apparently the pastoral needs of the day trumped almost everything.&nbsp; And—here is the point—no one then saw much wrong with such an approach.&nbsp; The theological and liturgical rigorism of those advocating “corrective baptism” were foreign to their worldview and liturgical praxis.</p>
<p>One also would want to know what the advocates of corrective baptism think happens during the chrismation of the convert.&nbsp; It is, I am told, accepted that such a convert after his chrismation is within the Church.&nbsp; Given that the Church is the Spirit-filled Body of Christ, what is then still lacking?&nbsp; Is it suggested that the convert’s sins are not forgiven?&nbsp; That the convert is not regenerated?&nbsp; Or perhaps only <em>partially</em> regenerated?&nbsp; (If so, what can a “partial regeneration” actually mean?)&nbsp; Is it suggested that the convert does not possess the Holy Spirit?&nbsp; If it is acknowledged that the chrismated convert has been forgiven, born again, and given the Holy Spirit, then what in the name of all the Seven Ecumenical Councils is experientially lacking?&nbsp; Devout Protestants are (I suggest) saved and experience the Holy Spirit, but they are still in some sense outside the Church.&nbsp; If the chrismated convert is <em>inside</em> the Church, what could still be missing in his conversion?</p>
<p>Corrective baptism is, I suggest, liturgical legalism on steroids.&nbsp; It also brings up the question of what kind of God we think we are serving.&nbsp; Is He a deity who refuses a full infusion of grace because a liturgical detail was missed?&nbsp; Most clergy know of cases where trembling legalistic souls are worried and angsty because the baptized person’s scalp or back didn’t go entirely under the water during their baptismal immersion, and want the offending scalp or back to be correctively dunked later on.</p>
<p>To them we would ask the same question:&nbsp; are they suggesting that God withholds His grace until the immersion meets the required specifications? &nbsp;In such baptisms, do the angels wring their hands invisibly and say to each other, “Alas, alas!&nbsp; He missed a spot”?&nbsp; The question is not liturgical, but theological.&nbsp; Is the God of grace a legalist?&nbsp; Or does “the grace divine which always heals that which is weak and completes that which is wanting” make up for the un-immersed scalp and back?</p>
<p>The practice of “corrective baptism” is dangerous because it suggests an unworthy and legalistic view of God.&nbsp; It verges on turning sacraments into magic, and liturgical words into verbal spells.&nbsp; As said above, I would be quite happy to baptize pretty much everyone.&nbsp; But the God whom we serve, in both baptism and chrismation, is no legalist, but the God of grace, the One who accepted the penitent thief into paradise without any ceremony, and One who wants all to be saved. Those promoting corrective baptism not only disturb the peace of the Church and seek to usurp the place of its bishops.&nbsp; They also offer an unworthy picture of God.</p>

			title: "Martyrdom of Polycarp",
			contents: `<h3>Chapter I.—Subject of which we write.</h3>
<p>We have written to you, brethren, as to what relates to the martyrs, and especially to the blessed Polycarp, who put an end to the persecution, having, as it were, set a seal upon it by his martyrdom. For almost all the events that happened previously [to this one], took place that the Lord might show us from above a martyrdom becoming the Gospel. For he waited to be delivered up, even as the Lord had done, that we also might become his followers, while we look not merely at what concerns ourselves but have regard also to our neighbours. For it is the part of a true and well-founded love, not only to wish one’s self to be saved, but also all the brethren.</p>
	<h3>Chapter II.—The wonderful constancy of the martyrs.</h3>
<p>All the martyrdoms, then, were blessed and noble which took place according to the will of God. For it becomes us who profess422 greater piety than others, to ascribe the authority over all things to God. And truly,423 who can fail to admire their nobleness of mind, and their patience, with that love towards their Lord which they displayed?—who, when they were so torn with scourges, that the frame of their bodies, even to the very inward veins and arteries, was laid open, still patiently endured, while even those that stood by pitied and bewailed them. But they reached such a pitch of magnanimity, that not one of them let a sigh or a groan escape them; thus proving to us all that those holy martyrs of Christ, at the very time when they suffered such torments, were absent from the body, or rather, that the Lord then stood by them, and communed with them. And, looking to the grace of Christ, they despised all the torments of this world, redeeming themselves from eternal punishment by [the suffering of] a single hour. For this reason the fire of their savage executioners appeared cool to them. For they kept before their view escape from that fire which is eternal and never shall be quenched, and looked forward with the eyes of their heart to those good things which are laid up for such as endure; things “which ear hath not heard, nor eye seen, neither have entered into the heart of man,”424 but were revealed by the Lord to them, inasmuch as they were no longer men, but had already become angels. And, in like manner, those who were condemned to the wild beasts endured dreadful tortures, being stretched out upon beds full of spikes, and subjected to various other kinds of torments, in order that, if it were possible, the tyrant might, by their lingering tortures, lead them to a denial [of Christ].</p>`,
