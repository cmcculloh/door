The mouth of the wise speaketh wisdom, and the truth delivereth them from death. If a righteous man dies, hope doth not, for the son of the righteous is born to life, and in his own good things he acquireth the fruit of righteousness. There is always light for the righteous and they obtain grace and glory from the Lord. The tongue of the wise is a good sister-in-law, and in their hearts resteth wisdom. The Lord loveth the hearts of the holy, and acceptable to Him are all the undefiled in the way.</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>The wisdom of the Lord illumineth the faces of the wise. For she takes hold of those desiring her by making herself first known to them. She is easily seen by those who love her. He who rises early to seek her shall have no difficulty, and those keeping vigil for the sake of her shall quickly be without sorrows. For she goeth about seeking those worthy of her, and graciously revealeth herself in the pathways. Against wisdom evil doth not prevail.</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>Therefore I was a lover of her beauty; I loved her and sought her out from my youth. I desired to make her my bride, and even the Master of All loved her. For she is an initiate in the knowledge of God, and a discoverer of His works. Her labors are virtues, for she teaches temperance and prudence, justice and courage; nothing in life is more necessary for men than these. And if anyone desireth much knowledge, she knoweth the things of old, and beholdeth things to come; she understandeth turns of speech and the solution of riddles; she has foreknowledge of signs and wonders and the outcome of times and seasons. She is a mediator of good things for all, for immortality is in her, and glory in the company of her words.</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Therefore I appealed to the Lord and prayed to Him, and said to Him with all my heart: “O God of my fathers and Lord of mercy, Who hast made all things by Thy word, and by Thy wisdom hast fashioned man that he should have dominion over the creatures made by Thee, that he should rule the world in holiness and righteousness: Give me wisdom that sits by Thy throne, and cast me not away from among Thy children, for I am Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaid. Send her forth from the heavens, from Thy holy abode, and from the throne of Thy glory, that she may be with me, and instruct me in what is pleasing to Thee. And she shall guide me in understanding, and preserve me in her glory. For the thoughts of mortals are miserable, and their intentions likely to fail.”</dd></dl>",

Who are you, my son?”</dd><dt>19</dt><dd>Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn; I have done just as you told me; please arise, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.”</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because the Lord your God brought it to me.”</dd><dt>21</dt><dd>Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.”</dd><dt>22</dt><dd>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”</dd><dt>23</dt><dd>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.</dd><dt>24</dt><dd>Then he said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He said, “I am.”</dd><dt>25</dt><dd>He said, “Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s game, so that my soul may bless you.” So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.</dd><dt>26</dt><dd>Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near now and kiss me, my son.”</dd><dt>27</dt><dd>And he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him and said: “Surely, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed.</dd><dt>28</dt><dd>Therefore may God give you of the dew of heaven, of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine.</dd><dt>29</dt><dd>Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be master over your brethren, and let your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be those who bless you!” </dd><dt>30</dt><dd>Now it happened, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>He also had made savory food, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that your soul may bless me.”</dd><dt>32</dt><dd>And his father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” So he said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”</dd><dt>33</dt><dd>Then Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, “Who? Where is the one who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it before you came, and I have blessed him – and indeed he shall be blessed.”</dd><dt>34</dt><dd>When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me – me also, O my father!”</dd><dt>35</dt><dd>But he said, “Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.”</dd><dt>36</dt><dd>And Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and now look, he has taken away my blessing!” And he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”</dd><dt>37</dt><dd>Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Indeed I have made him your master, and all his brethren I have given to him as servants; with grain and wine I have sustained him. What shall I do now for you, my son?”</dd><dt>38</dt><dd>And Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me – me also, O my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</dd><dt>39</dt><dd>Then Isaac his father answered and said to him: “Behold, your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above.</dd><dt>40</dt><dd>By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass, when you become restless, that you shall break his yoke from your neck.”</dd><dt>41</dt><dd>So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”</dd></dl>",

The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</dd><dt>42</dt><dd>Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, “O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.”</dd><dt>43</dt><dd>And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</dd><dt>44</dt><dd>So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</dd><dt>45</dt><dd>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</dd><dt>46</dt><dd>Rise, let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand.”</dd><dt>47</dt><dd>And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.</dd><dt>48</dt><dd>Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.”</dd><dt>49</dt><dd>Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.</dd><dt>50</dt><dd>But Jesus said to him, “Friend, why have you come?” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him.</dd><dt>51</dt><dd>And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</dd><dt>52</dt><dd>But Jesus said to him, “Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</dd><dt>53</dt><dd>Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?</dd><dt>54</dt><dd>How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?”</dd><dt>55</dt><dd>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, “Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.”</dd><dt>56</dt><dd>But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.</dd><dt>57</dt><dd>And those who had laid hold of Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</dd><dt>58</dt><dd>But Peter followed Him at a distance to the high priest’s courtyard. And he went in and sat with the servants to see the end.</dd><dt>59</dt><dd>Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the council sought false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death,</dd><dt>60</dt><dd>but found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward</dd><dt>61</dt><dd>and said, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.’”</dd><dt>62</dt><dd>And the high priest arose and said to Him, “Do You answer nothing? What is it these men testify against You?”</dd><dt>63</dt><dd>But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, “I put You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!”</dd><dt>64</dt><dd>Jesus said to him, “It is as you said. Nevertheless, I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</dd><dt>65</dt><dd>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard His blasphemy!</dd><dt>66</dt><dd>What do you think?” They answered and said, “He is deserving of death.”</dd><dt>67</dt><dd>Then they spat in His face and beat Him; and others struck Him with the palms of their hands,</dd><dt>68</dt><dd>saying, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck You?”</dd><dt>69</dt><dd>Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, “You also were with Jesus of Galilee.”</dd><dt>70</dt><dd>But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you are saying.”</dd><dt>71</dt><dd>And when he had gone out to the gateway, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, “This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.”</dd><dt>72</dt><dd>But again he denied with an oath, “I do not know the Man!”</dd><dt>73</dt><dd>And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter, “Surely you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you.”</dd><dt>74</dt><dd>Then he began to curse and swear, saying, “I do not know the Man!” Immediately a rooster crowed.</dd><dt>75</dt><dd>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” So he went out and wept bitterly.</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put Him to death.</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>And when they had bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</dd></dl>",

It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</dd><dt>9</dt><dd>of sin, because they do not believe in Me;</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come.</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.</dd><dt>15</dt><dd>All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you. </dd><dt>16</dt><dd>A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I go to the Father.”</dd><dt>17</dt><dd>Then some of His disciples said among themselves, “What is this that He says to us, ‘A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me’; and, ‘because I go to the Father’?”</dd><dt>18</dt><dd>They said therefore, “What is this that He says, ‘A little while’? We do not know what He is saying.”</dd><dt>19</dt><dd>Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to them, “Are you inquiring among yourselves about what I said, ‘A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me’?</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>Most assuredly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.</dd><dt>21</dt><dd>A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world.</dd><dt>22</dt><dd>Therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you.</dd><dt>23</dt><dd>And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you.</dd><dt>24</dt><dd>Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.</dd><dt>25</dt><dd>These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but I will tell you plainly about the Father.</dd><dt>26</dt><dd>In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;</dd><dt>27</dt><dd>for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from God.</dd><dt>28</dt><dd>I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.” </dd><dt>29</dt><dd>His disciples said to Him, “See, now You are speaking plainly, and using no figure of speech!</dd><dt>30</dt><dd>Now we are sure that You know all things, and have no need that anyone should question You. By this we believe that You came forth from God.”</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe?</dd><dt>32</dt><dd>Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, that you will be scattered, each to his own, and will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.</dd><dt>33</dt><dd>These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>Jesus spoke these words, lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said: “Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You,</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>as You have given Him authority over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him.</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.</dd><dt>5</dt><dd>And now, O Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>I have manifested Your name to the men whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>Now they have known that all things which You have given Me are from You.</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>For I have given to them the words which You have given Me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came forth from You; and they have believed that You sent Me.</dd><dt>9</dt><dd>I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them.</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You.

Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?”</dd><dt>36</dt><dd>Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.”</dd><dt>37</dt><dd>Pilate therefore said to Him, “Are You a king then?” Jesus answered, “You say rightly that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.”</dd><dt>38</dt><dd>Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, “I find no fault in Him at all.</dd><dt>39</dt><dd>But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”</dd><dt>40</dt><dd>Then they all cried again, saying, “Not this Man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.</dd><dt>1</dt><dd>So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe.</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>Then they said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” And they struck Him with their hands.</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Pilate then went out again, and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in Him.”</dd><dt>5</dt><dd>Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, “Behold the Man!”</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, “Crucify Him, crucify Him!” Pilate said to them, “You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him.”</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.”</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid,</dd><dt>9</dt><dd>and went again into the Praetorium, and said to Jesus, “Where are You from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>Then Pilate said to Him, “Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have power to crucify You, and power to release You?”</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>Jesus answered, “You could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.”</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar’s friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.”</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, “Behold your King!”</dd><dt>15</dt><dd>But they cried out, “Away with Him, away with Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”</dd><dt>16</dt><dd>Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led Him away. </dd><dt>17</dt><dd>And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,</dd><dt>18</dt><dd>where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center.</dd><dt>19</dt><dd>Now Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</dd><dt>20</dt><dd>Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</dd><dt>21</dt><dd>Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, “I am the King of the Jews.”’”</dd><dt>22</dt><dd>Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”</dd><dt>23</dt><dd>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece.</dd><dt>24</dt><dd>They said therefore among themselves, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.” Therefore the soldiers did this.</dd><dt>25</dt><dd>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</dd><dt>26</dt><dd>When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, “Woman, behold your son!”</dd><dt>27</dt><dd>Then He said to the disciple, “Behold your mother!” And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.</dd><dt>28</dt><dd>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, “I thirst!”</dd><dt>29</dt><dd>Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on hyssop, and put it to His mouth.</dd><dt>30</dt><dd>So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished!” And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.</dd><dt>31</dt><dd>Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</dd><dt>32</dt><dd>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him.</dd><dt>33</dt><dd>But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.</dd><dt>34</dt><dd>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</dd><dt>35</dt><dd>And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may believe.</dd><dt>36</dt><dd>For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, “Not one of His bones shall be broken.” </dd><dt>37</dt><dd>And again another Scripture says, “They shall look on Him whom they pierced.” </dd></dl>",

The mouth of the wise speaketh wisdom, and the truth delivereth them from death. If a righteous man dies, hope doth not, for the son of the righteous is born to life, and in his own good things he acquireth the fruit of righteousness. There is always light for the righteous and they obtain grace and glory from the Lord. The tongue of the wise is a good sister-in-law, and in their hearts resteth wisdom. The Lord loveth the hearts of the holy, and acceptable to Him are all the undefiled in the way.</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>The wisdom of the Lord illumineth the faces of the wise. For she takes hold of those desiring her by making herself first known to them. She is easily seen by those who love her. He who rises early to seek her shall have no difficulty, and those keeping vigil for the sake of her shall quickly be without sorrows. For she goeth about seeking those worthy of her, and graciously revealeth herself in the pathways. Against wisdom evil doth not prevail.</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>Therefore I was a lover of her beauty; I loved her and sought her out from my youth. I desired to make her my bride, and even the Master of All loved her. For she is an initiate in the knowledge of God, and a discoverer of His works. Her labors are virtues, for she teaches temperance and prudence, justice and courage; nothing in life is more necessary for men than these. And if anyone desireth much knowledge, she knoweth the things of old, and beholdeth things to come; she understandeth turns of speech and the solution of riddles; she has foreknowledge of signs and wonders and the outcome of times and seasons. She is a mediator of good things for all, for immortality is in her, and glory in the company of her words.</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Therefore I appealed to the Lord and prayed to Him, and said to Him with all my heart: “O God of my fathers and Lord of mercy, Who hast made all things by Thy word, and by Thy wisdom hast fashioned man that he should have dominion over the creatures made by Thee, that he should rule the world in holiness and righteousness: Give me wisdom that sits by Thy throne, and cast me not away from among Thy children, for I am Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaid. Send her forth from the heavens, from Thy holy abode, and from the throne of Thy glory, that she may be with me, and instruct me in what is pleasing to Thee. And she shall guide me in understanding, and preserve me in her glory. For the thoughts of mortals are miserable, and their intentions likely to fail.”</dd></dl>",

Honor wisdom that you may reign forever.</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>I will tell you and not hide the mysteries of God from you. For He is the Guide of wisdom, the Corrector of the wise and the Artisan of all thoughts and deeds. Wisdom will teach with all understanding: For in her is a Spirit, intelligent and holy, the Radiance of the Everlasting Light and the Image of the Grace of God.</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>She fashions friends of God and prophets. For she is more beautiful than the sun and above all the order of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be first. She delivered from infirmities those pleasing her and guided them on the paths of righteousness. She gave to them understanding to be holy and to preserve them from those who would ensnare them, and she granted them strength in struggles, so that all might understand that the most powerful of all is piety, and that evil might not prevail against wisdom, nor judgment pass away without convicting the wicked.</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Having reasoned unrighteously, they said to themselves, “Let us oppress the righteous man and not spare his venerableness, nor let us be ashamed of the gray hairs of the old man of many years. But let our might be our law and let us seize the righteous, because he is inconvenient to us and is opposed to our deeds; he reproaches us for apostasy against the law and divulges the sins of our training.</dd><dt>5</dt><dd>“He declares to us to have knowledge of God and calls himself a child of the Lord. He became to us a reproof of our thoughts; the very sight of him is a burden to us, because his life is unlike that of others, and his ways are very different. We are considered by him to be an insult, and he avoids our ways as unclean; he calls the end of the righteous blessed.</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>“Let us see if his words are true; let us test him to see what will happen to him. Let us torment him with revilement and tortures, that we may understand his meekness and test his guilelessness. Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for, according to his own words, he shall be respected.”</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>Thus they reasoned, but were deceived, for their wickedness blinded them. They did not know the mysteries of God, nor did they discern that Thou alone art God, having the power of life and death: Who savest in times of affliction and deliverest from every evil; Who art compassionate and merciful, granting Grace to His venerable ones, and opposing the proud with His arm.</dd></dl>",

And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him liberty to go to his friends and receive care.</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>When we had put to sea from there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</dd><dt>5</dt><dd>And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on board.</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>When we had sailed slowly many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to proceed, we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Salmone.</dd><dt>8</dt><dd>Passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.</dd><dt>9</dt><dd>Now when much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous because the Fast was already over, Paul advised them,</dd><dt>10</dt><dd>saying, “Men, I perceive that this voyage will end with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.”</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul.</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to set sail from there also, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest, and winter there.</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their desire, putting out to sea, they sailed close by Crete.</dd><dt>14</dt><dd>But not long after, a tempestuous head wind arose, called Euroclydon.</dd><dt>15</dt><dd>So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let her drive.</dd><dt>16</dt><dd>And running under the shelter of an island called Clauda, we secured the skiff with difficulty.</dd><dt>17</dt><dd>When they had taken it on board, they used cables to undergird the ship;

but they observed a bay with a beach, onto which they planned to run the ship if possible.</dd><dt>40</dt><dd>And they let go the anchors and left them in the sea, meanwhile loosing the rudder ropes; and they hoisted the mainsail to the wind and made for shore.</dd><dt>41</dt><dd>But striking a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.</dd><dt>42</dt><dd>And the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape.</dd><dt>43</dt><dd>But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land,</dd><dt>44</dt><dd>and the rest, some on boards and some on parts of the ship.

And they prophesied until the evening; and it came to pass that it was the time of the offering of the scarifice, but there was no voice.</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>And Elijah spoke to the prophets of shame, saying, “Stand by for the present, and I will offer my sacrifice.” And they stood aside and were silent.

And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, as the Lord had said to him, “Israel shall be your name.”</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>And he built up the stones in the name of the Lord, and repaired the altar that had been broken down; and he made a trench for water that would hold two measures of seed round about the altar. And he piled the cleft wood on the altar which he had made, and divided the whole burnt-offering, and laid on the wood and around the altar. And Elijah said, “Fetch me four jars of water and pour it on the whole-burnt-offering, and on the wood.” And they did so. And he said, “Do it a second time”; and they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time”; and they did it a third time.

And the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab wept and went to Jezreel. And the hand of the Lord was upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab to Jezreel.</dd><dt>11</dt><dd>And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had slain the prophets with the sword. And Jezebel sent to Elijah, saying “By this time tomorrow I will make your life as the life of one of them.” And Elijah heard and was afraid; and he rose and departed for his life. And he came to Beersheba, in the land of Judah.</dd><dt>12</dt><dd>And he left his servant there and went a days journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree; and he asked, concerning his life, that he might die, and said, “ Let it be enough, O Lord; now take away my life from me; for I am no better than my fathers.” And he lay down and slept under the tree. And behold, an angel of the Lord touched him and said to him, “Arise, eat and drink.” And Elijah looked, and behold, at his head there was a cake of barley and cruse of water. And he arose, and ate and drank, and lay down again and slept.</dd><dt>13</dt><dd>And the angel of the Lord returned a second time, and touched him, and said to him, “Arise, eat and drink, for the journey will be too much for you.” And he arose, and ate and drank.

The mouth of the wise speaketh wisdom, and the truth delivereth them from death.

There is always light for the righteous and they obtain grace and glory from the Lord. The tongue of the wise is a good sister-in-law, and in their hearts resteth wisdom.

For she goeth about seeking those worthy of her, and graciously revealeth herself in the pathways. Against wisdom evil doth not prevail.</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>Therefore I was a lover of her beauty; I loved her and sought her out from my youth. I desired to make her my bride, and even the Master of All loved her. For she is an initiate in the knowledge of God, and a discoverer of His works.

And if anyone desireth much knowledge, she knoweth the things of old, and beholdeth things to come; she understandeth turns of speech and the solution of riddles; she has foreknowledge of signs and wonders and the outcome of times and seasons. She is a mediator of good things for all, for immortality is in her, and glory in the company of her words.</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Therefore I appealed to the Lord and prayed to Him, and said to Him with all my heart: “O God of my fathers and Lord of mercy, Who hast made all things by Thy word, and by Thy wisdom hast fashioned man that he should have dominion over the creatures made by Thee, that he should rule the world in holiness and righteousness: Give me wisdom that sits by Thy throne, and cast me not away from among Thy children, for I am Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaid. Send her forth from the heavens, from Thy holy abode, and from the throne of Thy glory, that she may be with me, and instruct me in what is pleasing to Thee. And she shall guide me in understanding, and preserve me in her glory. For the thoughts of mortals are miserable, and their intentions likely to fail.”</dd></dl>",

He who rises early to seek her shall have no difficulty, and those keeping vigil for the sake of her shall quickly be without sorrows. For she goeth about seeking those worthy of her, and graciously revealeth herself in the pathways. Against wisdom evil doth not prevail.</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>Therefore I was a lover of her beauty; I loved her and sought her out from my youth. I desired to make her my bride, and even the Master of All loved her. For she is an initiate in the knowledge of God, and a discoverer of His works. Her labors are virtues, for she teaches temperance and prudence, justice and courage; nothing in life is more necessary for men than these. And if anyone desireth much knowledge, she knoweth the things of old, and beholdeth things to come; she understandeth turns of speech and the solution of riddles; she has foreknowledge of signs and wonders and the outcome of times and seasons. She is a mediator of good things for all, for immortality is in her, and glory in the company of her words.</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Therefore I appealed to the Lord and prayed to Him, and said to Him with all my heart: “O God of my fathers and Lord of mercy, Who hast made all things by Thy word, and by Thy wisdom hast fashioned man that he should have dominion over the creatures made by Thee, that he should rule the world in holiness and righteousness: Give me wisdom that sits by Thy throne, and cast me not away from among Thy children, for I am Thy servant and the son of Thy handmaid. Send her forth from the heavens, from Thy holy abode, and from the throne of Thy glory, that she may be with me, and instruct me in what is pleasing to Thee. And she shall guide me in understanding, and preserve me in her glory. For the thoughts of mortals are miserable, and their intentions likely to fail.”</dd></dl>",

Therefore love wisdom, O men, and live. Desire her and be instructed: For her beginning is love and the keeping of her laws. Honor wisdom that you may reign forever.</dd><dt>2</dt><dd>I will tell you and not hide the mysteries of God from you. For He is the Guide of wisdom, the Corrector of the wise and the Artisan of all thoughts and deeds. Wisdom will teach with all understanding: For in her is a Spirit, intelligent and holy, the Radiance of the Everlasting Light and the Image of the Grace of God.</dd><dt>3</dt><dd>She fashions friends of God and prophets. For she is more beautiful than the sun and above all the order of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be first. She delivered from infirmities those pleasing her and guided them on the paths of righteousness. She gave to them understanding to be holy and to preserve them from those who would ensnare them, and she granted them strength in struggles, so that all might understand that the most powerful of all is piety, and that evil might not prevail against wisdom, nor judgment pass away without convicting the wicked.</dd><dt>4</dt><dd>Having reasoned unrighteously, they said to themselves, “Let us oppress the righteous man and not spare his venerableness, nor let us be ashamed of the gray hairs of the old man of many years. But let our might be our law and let us seize the righteous, because he is inconvenient to us and is opposed to our deeds; he reproaches us for apostasy against the law and divulges the sins of our training.</dd><dt>5</dt><dd>“He declares to us to have knowledge of God and calls himself a child of the Lord. He became to us a reproof of our thoughts; the very sight of him is a burden to us, because his life is unlike that of others, and his ways are very different. We are considered by him to be an insult, and he avoids our ways as unclean; he calls the end of the righteous blessed.</dd><dt>6</dt><dd>“Let us see if his words are true; let us test him to see what will happen to him. Let us torment him with revilement and tortures, that we may understand his meekness and test his guilelessness. Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for, according to his own words, he shall be respected.”</dd><dt>7</dt><dd>Thus they reasoned, but were deceived, for their wickedness blinded them. They did not know the mysteries of God, nor did they discern that Thou alone art God, having the power of life and death: Who savest in times of affliction and deliverest from every evil; Who art compassionate and merciful, granting Grace to His venerable ones, and opposing the proud with His arm.</dd></dl>",
